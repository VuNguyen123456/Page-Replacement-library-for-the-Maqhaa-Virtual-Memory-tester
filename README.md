# Page-Replacement-library-for-the-Maqhaa-Virtual-Memory-tester

This project focuses on implementing a Page Replacement library to support the Maqhaa Virtual Memory tester. The primary objective is to complete nine functions within the provided src/pr.c file to manage memory pages effectively. These functions are designed to handle page replacement using the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm, ensuring that when physical memory frames are full, the least-used page is replaced to accommodate new pages. The project emphasizes working with arrays in C and leverages fundamental programming techniques to handle memory operations efficiently.

The Maqhaa tester simulates real-world operating system behavior by dividing memory into pages and frames. Programs access memory through virtual page numbers, and when a requested page is not present in RAM, it is loaded into an available frame. If no frames are free, the LRU page is replaced. The provided codebase already includes most of the Maqhaa implementation, leaving only the Page Replacement library incomplete. This modular approach mirrors industry practices, where developers enhance existing codebases rather than creating systems from scratch.

This practice project is entirely optional, offering an opportunity to strengthen C programming skills through hands-on experience. It demonstrates how to interpret project documentation, design functions, debug errors, and test solutions effectively. To support learning, a professor-written solution and tutorial videos are available to guide students through the process. The project emphasizes iterative skill improvement, focusing on implementing small, targeted features within a larger framework.
